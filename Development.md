## Design, Development and Testing Log

### 16.5.24

I have been working on my database version 1.

![Database V1](images/Database_v1.png)

I have worked on my database, I have gotten the car table and have got 2 columns in so far 'Make' and 'Model', I have got the Sightings table done as well, the table has: id, Car.id, Date_time, and Location.

> If I was looking at spotting a car, some of the details I would like to know would be, what colour, what year, how many owners (if possible), kilometres travelled (if possible), and condition inside and out.

This is database version 2.

I have followed my clients advice and have added more columns into my database table that have the names of what my client stated.


### 20.5.24

I am working on my User flow design version 1.

![UI design V1](images/UI_design_v1.png)

I have made a outline of what my ui flow design could be, when the client opens up the website indicated by the word 'Start', they will be sent directly to a list of previously spotted cars, from there, there could be a add button to add a new car sighting to the site and a cancel button if they need to revert out of the new sighting page. When my client clicks/taps on a previously sighted car, it would come up with the car details.

>I suggested to add another box and make that a watchlist.

I listened to my clients advice and added another box and arrow which says 'Watchlist'.



### 21.5.24

I have done some minor changes to my UI flow design.

![UI design V3](images/UI_design_v3.png)

I have tweaked the colour of my boxes and I have added more arrows showing how th user will be able to get back out of the car details page and the watchlist page, I have also added a submit arrow for when a new car sighting is ready to be added.

### 27.5.24

I have been working on mu Ui interface in Figma.

![UI interface V2](images/UI_interface_V1.png)

This is my UI interface design for my Car Spotting website, it consists of 4 pages, 'Watchlist', 'Home Page', 'New car Form', and 'Car Details'. The 4 pages have similar designs in them as well as minimal colours. I will be showing this to my client and be getting feedback from them.

>For a car database website it looks fine so far, maybe in the New Car Form, you could have examples in each of the fields like Make is mitsubishi, model is Galant VR4 etc. Looking forward to adding some cars and details to it so we can fine tune the details if required.

### 30.5.24

This is my version 2 of the UI interface for my Car Spotting website.

![UI interface V2](images/UI_interface_V2.png)

This is version 2 of my UI interface for my site, the improvements/changes that I have done to my ui interface v2 is the following: I have added detail buttons onto my watchlisted car list and have put 'e.g.' examples into the new car form field list. I will talk to my client to see if they are happy with this change.

### 10.6.24

I have been working on my colours for my UI design.

![Colour Choices](images/Colours_V1.png)

Today I worked on my colour choices , I have chosen neutral green and blue colours that aren't too crazy but also don't too much com pared to some other colour palettes. I will be showing my client This colour option and getting feed back on it.

>These colours look suitable for the layout of this website, the only thing that I would say to change is the blueish-purple in the new car form and details form to a darker colour to kae it stand out more. Other then that I am very happy with the way it is turning out.

![Colour Choices V2](images/Colours_V2.png)

I have followed up with my clients advice and changed the new car form and details forms fields to have a darker colour, this is to ensure the fields stand out more and to make the colour palette fit the overall site.
