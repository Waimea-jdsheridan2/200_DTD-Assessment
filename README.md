# Car Spotting

This is my Level 2 NCEA project for Digital Technologies

It is a database-connected website that allows users to:

- Have a list of previous car sightings.
- Allows the user to add a car to the system.
- Allows the user to add a new sighting to the system.
- Allows the user to view a list of previous cars sighted.
